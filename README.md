# RegistryLibrary
Provides access to the Windows Registry via executing "REG ..." command

With the library you are able to:
* Create keys
* Create values
* Change type of a value
* Change data of a value
* Remove keys
* Remove values

You may want to take a quick look at the [examples](https://github.com/MrPythoneer/RegistryLibrary/tree/master/src/examples/java). (There's actually not much to look at)

Between, I'm just learning Java by myself so sorry if you don't like how the code looks like.
